title: Categorical counterfactuals
---

Suppose we have a category structure such that `A` and `B` are categories, and such that there is a single Boolean feature with a value that depends on the category.

Let's first consider deterministic dependence:

;;;fold: various
;;first we have a bunch of helper code to do meta-transforms.. converts name to shadow-name and wraps top-level defines
(define (names model)
  (map (lambda (def)
         (if (is-function-definition? def)
             (first (second def))
             (second def)))
       model))

(define (is-function-definition? def)
  (list? (second def)))

(define (shadow-symbol name)
  (string->symbol (string-append "shadow-" name)))

(define (rename expr from-name to-name)
  (cond [(list? expr) (map (lambda (x) (rename x from-name to-name)) expr)]
        [(eq? expr from-name) to-name]
        [else expr]))

(define (shadow-rename expr name)
  (rename expr name (shadow-symbol name)))

(define (shadow-rename-all expr names)
  (if (null? names)
      expr
      (shadow-rename-all (shadow-rename expr (first names))
                         (rest names))))

(define (make-shadow-defines model)
  (define ns (names model))
  (map (lambda (def)
         (if (is-function-definition? def)

                                                  ,name)))))
       model))

  '(and ,a ,b
        (apply multinomial

          #t
          #f))

(define a '(feature-on))

    #t)))
~~~~

As expected, the counterfactual statements ("if it weren't in category A, then the feature wouldn't be on") is #t with probability 1.

Now let's relax the dependence to a stochastic dependence with weight .99:

The counterfactual statement is now only true with probability slightly greater than .5. Intuitively, we would expect that the statement should still have probability close to 1.
