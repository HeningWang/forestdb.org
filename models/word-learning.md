This is a webchurch implementation of a model in Ref:Xu2007dt.

Consider the following tree:

>             [o]       (height = 1)
>              |
>             [a]       (height = 0.8)
>           /    \
>         /       \
>       [b]      [e]    (height = 0.3)
>       / \     /  \
>     [c] [d] [f] [g]   (height = 0)
>      1  4    5   7
>      2       6   8
>      3           9

Here, inner nodes represent hierarchical category labels (e.g., living thing, mammal, dog).
The height of a node is a proxy for the size of its extension (e.g., because [o] is high,
it might denote a large class, like "objects that can be thought about").

Leaves represent objects that are nameable. The inference problem is this: suppose that a single label (e.g., dog) has been used to label multiple objects (e.g., 1, 2, and 4). which ontological category does this label map onto?

    
    (define nodes '(a b c d e f g))
    (define heights '((o 1) (a 0.8) (b 0.3) (e 0.3) (c 0) (d 0) (f 0) (g 0) ))
    (define parents '((o #f) (a o) (b a) (e a) (c b) (d b) (f e) (g e)
                      (1 c) (2 c) (3 c) (4 d) (5 f) (6 f) (7 g) (8 g) (9 g)))

          (if (equal? q r)
              #t
              (is-child? (node->parent q) r))))
    
    (define (node->height x) (second (assoc x heights)) )
    (define (node->parent x) (second (assoc x parents)) )
    
    ;; define unnormalized prior probabilities
    (define weights* (map (lambda (x) (- (node->height (node->parent x))
                                         (node->height x)))
                          nodes))
    
    ;; normalize prior probabilities
    (define weights
    	(let ([denom (sum weights*)])
    		(map (lambda (x) (/ x denom)) weights*)))
    
    ;; data that we've observed
    (define data '(1 2))
    (define k (length data))
    
    (define epsilon 0.05)
    
    (define (likelihood* x) (expt (+ (node->height x) epsilon) (- 0 k)))
    (define likelihood-denom (sum (map likelihood* nodes)))

       (if (all (map (lambda (x) (is-child? x node))
                     data))
