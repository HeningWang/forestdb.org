A model of learning from social and direct evidence:

The learner is tasked with learning the weight of a coin. She observes some number *n-l* of flips. A second person, "Zach," sees *n-z* flips and then bets on the outcome of the next flip. The learner doesn't see the outcomes of Zach's *n-z* flips, but she does see how he bets.
