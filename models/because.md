title: Explanations with 'because'

### Pragmatic explainer

We model an informative speaker trying to communicate the world state (all top-level vars in a model) to a literal listener.


#### The literal meaning of "because"

The meaning of "A because B" is both the presuppositions -- "A" and "B" -- and the counterfactual "if B had not happened then A would not have happened". The counterfactual is implemented by creating "shadow" world where each top-level (i.e. defined) variable in the model has its actual-world value with `eps` probability and a fresh value otherwise. In this shadow world we evaluate a conditional query to see if "shadow-A" changes when "shadow-B" is conditioned to be false.

To construct the shadow-world query we use a bunch of helpers for splicing, wrapping definitions, and renaming variables. Here it is, with an example:

~~~~
;;;
;;first we have a bunch of helper code to do meta-transforms.. converts name to shadow-name and wraps top-level defines
(define (names model)
  (map (lambda (def)
         (if (is-function-definition? def)
             (first (second def))
             (second def)))
       model))

(define (is-function-definition? def)
  (list? (second def)))

(define (shadow-symbol name)
  (string->symbol (string-append "shadow-" name)))

(define (rename expr from-name to-name)
  (cond [(list? expr) (map (lambda (x) (rename x from-name to-name)) expr)]
        [(eq? expr from-name) to-name]
        [else expr]))

(define (shadow-rename expr name)
  (rename expr name (shadow-symbol name)))

(define (shadow-rename-all expr names)
  (if (null? names)
      expr
      (shadow-rename-all (shadow-rename expr (first names))
                         (rest names))))

(define (make-shadow-defines model)
  (define ns (names model))
  (map (lambda (def)
         (if (is-function-definition? def)
             (shadow-rename-all def ns)
             (let ([name (second def)])
               '(define ,(shadow-symbol name) (if (flip eps) 
                                                  ,(shadow-rename-all (third def) ns) 
                                                  ,name)))))
       model))

(define model 
  '((define a (flip .2))
    (define c (flip .5))
    (define b (flip (if (or a c) 0.9 0.1)))))

(display (make-shadow-defines model))

Now the meaning of "because" is simply constructing the shadow-world query using these helpers:

;;first we have a bunch of helper code to do meta-transforms.. converts name to shadow-name and wraps top-level defines
(define (names model)
  (map (lambda (def)
         (if (is-function-definition? def)
             (first (second def))
             (second def)))
       model))

(define (is-function-definition? def)
  (list? (second def)))

(define (shadow-symbol name)
  (string->symbol (string-append "shadow-" name)))

(define (rename expr from-name to-name)
  (cond [(list? expr) (map (lambda (x) (rename x from-name to-name)) expr)]
        [(eq? expr from-name) to-name]
        [else expr]))

(define (shadow-rename expr name)
  (rename expr name (shadow-symbol name)))

(define (shadow-rename-all expr names)
  (if (null? names)
      expr
      (shadow-rename-all (shadow-rename expr (first names))
                         (rest names))))

(define (make-shadow-defines model)

         (if (is-function-definition? def)
             (shadow-rename-all def ns)
             (let ([name (second def)])
               '(define ,(shadow-symbol name) (if (flip eps) 
                                                  ,(shadow-rename-all (third def) ns) 
                                                  ,name)))))
       model))
;;;

;;expand an expr with form '(because a b), ie "a because b", into the (hypothesized) counterfactual meaning:

                (condition (not ,(shadow-rename-all b (names model))))))))

(define model 
  '((define a (flip .2))
    (define c (flip .5))
    (define b (flip (if (or a c) 0.9 0.1)))))

(display (expand-because '(because a b)))
(display (expand-because  '(because a (and b c))))
~~~~

We can now plug this into the standard RSA literal listener that conditions on the literal meaning of an utterance being true. We dynamically construct the listener query and then eval it, in order to use the previous setup to construct the meaning expression.

Ta-da!

Next to understand if this meaning for "because" actually reflects people's intuitive understanding...
