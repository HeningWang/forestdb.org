Each player chooses actions by sampling an action, simulating the
game until the end, and choosing actions in proportion to how
likely they are to lead to a successful outcome at the end of the
game. This mental simulation includes reasoning about both players'
reasoning at all future game steps, including their reasoning about
the other player.
