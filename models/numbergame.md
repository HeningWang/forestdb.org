## Introduction

AI has become increasingly good at processing and making sense of the huge amounts of messy, unstructured data that we have on the Internet. It is commonly believed that "Big Data" will revolutionalize AI, enabling machines to automatically acquire rich knowledge from data, and, ultimately, behave intelligently. While the sheer amount of data that the ditigal world has accumulated is undoubtedly powerful, it is often useful to take a step back and think about how humans---the most intelligent machines we have around---reason about and learn from data. Humans don't always require thousands of data points to learn concepts and draw conclusions. Often, we see a small amount of data and draw highly reasonable conclusions about it. This is sometimes called an "inductive leap:" observing small pieces of evidence, making generalizations about them, and using these generalizations to draw larger conclusions and make predictions.

Let's make this idea of inductive reasoning a bit more concrete with a simple example.

Suppose your friend shows you this sequence of numbers and tells you that they are "positive examples" of a category of numbers: {16, 8, 64}.

(Note: "positive examples" are examples of that category; "negative examples" are examples that are *not* of that category.)

* Do you think 4 belongs to this category?
* What about 7?
* Or 10?

Now, suppose someone shows you this sequence of numbers and tells you that they are "positive examples" of a different category of numbers: {80, 10, 30}

* Do you think 4 belongs to this category?
* What about 7?
* Or 10?

How did you come up with these answers? What are your hypotheses about which number category your friend was thinking of?

## Hypotheses and generative models

Let's zoom in on the first sequence: {16, 8, 64}. In order to predict what other numbers might belong to this category, it can be useful to think about the process that *generated* these three numbers. Since there are several different number categories that we consider, there are also several different ways in which these numbers were generated from those categories.

### Powers of 2

Here is one way the numbers {16, 8, 64} could have been generated:

1. Your friend was thinking of the concept (or number category): "powers of 2".
2. Your friend randomly samples some numbers that are powers of 2.

This is what this generative process looks like in code:

~~~~
///fold:
// sample N items from an array, without replacement
var drawN = function(array, N) {
  if (N == 0) {
    return [];
  } else {
    var sampled = uniformDraw(array);
    var remaining = remove(sampled, array);
    return [sampled].concat(drawN(remaining, N-1));
  }
}
// sample 3 items from an array, without replacement
var draw3 = function(array) {
  return drawN(array, 3);
}
///

// first we make an array of all the powers of 2
// since there are infinitely many powers of 2, 
// for simplicty we restrict it to less than 50
var powers_of_2 = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32];

// then we sample 3 of those powers of 2:
var get_examples = function() {
  return draw3(powers_of_2)
};

get_examples();
~~~~

You can press the "run" button above multiple times to get different samples from this category. This is called a "simulation"---simulating the way your friend chooses different numbers.

You can also see graphs of this simulation. (Let's put our 3 numbers in order, so the graph looks nicer)

~~~~
///fold:
// sample N items from an array, without replacement
var drawN = function(array, N) {
  if (N == 0) {
    return [];
  } else {
    var sampled = uniformDraw(array);
    var remaining = remove(sampled, array);
    // NOTE: now we're sorting the result.
    return sort([sampled].concat(drawN(remaining, N-1)));
  }
}
// sample 3 items from an array, without replacement
var draw3 = function(array) {
  return drawN(array, 3);
}

// first we make an array of all the powers of 2 less than 50:
var powers_of_2 = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32];

// then we sample 3 of those powers of 2:
var get_examples = function() {return draw3(powers_of_2)};

get_examples();
///
print(Enumerate(get_examples));
~~~~  

### Multiples of 2

Of course, there are other ways the numbers {16, 8, 64} could have been generated:

1. Your friend was thinking of the concept (or number category): "multiples of 2".
2. Your friend randomly samples some numbers that are multiples of 2.

What is the more likely category given the numbers {16, 8, 64}: powers of 2, or multiples of 2?

## Inductive reasoning with probabilistic programs

It can be quite tedious to calculate the probabilites by hand. Instead, we can use "Probabilistic Programs" (programs that have some randomness and uncertainty in them) to let the computer figure out the answer for us. That is part of the power of programming!

### Generative Model

To write a program that does this work for us, we first need to give it some information we have about your friend and how she chooses numbers. We can do this in the form of a "Generative Model": in this case, a description of how your friend generates numbers.

Let's say your friend could be thinking of either "multiples of 2" or "powers of 2". For simplicity, let's also assume that she'll only give you numbers less than or equal to 10.

First, she randomly samples one of those concepts:

~~~~
var pick_concept = function() {
// uniformDraw will choose "powers_of_2" and "multiples_of_2" with equal probability.
  var concept = uniformDraw(["powers_of_2", "multiples_of_2"]);
  return concept;
}
// this graph confirms that the two concepts are each 50% likely to to be chosen.
print(Enumerate(pick_concept));
~~~~  

Then, whatever concept your friend chooses, she gives you 3 example numbers from that concept:

~~~~
///fold:
// sample N items from an array, without replacement
var drawN = function(array, N) {
  if (N == 0) {
    return [];
  } else {
    var sampled = uniformDraw(array);
    var remaining = remove(sampled, array);
    // NOTE: now we're sorting the result.
    return sort([sampled].concat(drawN(remaining, N-1)));
  }
}
// sample 3 items from an array, without replacement
var draw3 = function(array) {
  return drawN(array, 3);
}

var pick_concept = function() {
  var concept = uniformDraw(["powers_of_2", "multiples_of_2"]);
  return concept;
}
///

// make arrays of all the powers and multiples of 2 up to 10:
var concept_examples = {
  "powers_of_2": [1, 2, 4, 8],
  "multiples_of_2": [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
}

// in the generative model, we chose a concept, and then sample from it
var generate_examples = function() {
  var concept = pick_concept(); // this line picks a concept randomly
  var examples = draw3(concept_examples[concept]); // given the randomly chosen concept, choose 3 examples from it
  return examples;
}

print(Enumerate(generate_examples));
~~~~  

#### Questions
* What is the probability that [0, 4, 8] is chosen? (hint: put your mouse over the bar for [0, 4, 8])
* What is the probability that [1, 4, 8] is chosen?
* What is the probability that [2, 4, 8] is chosen?
* Which number sequence is most likely to be chosen? (bonus: Why?)

### Conditioning

In the last section, the program generated number sequences without knowing which concept was chosen. Suppose the chosen concept was "multiples of 2." Given this concept, what is the "Conditional Probability" of the sequence of [2, 4, 8]? 

~~~~
///fold:
// sample N items from an array, without replacement
var drawN = function(array, N) {
  if (N == 0) {
    return [];
  } else {
    var sampled = uniformDraw(array);
    var remaining = remove(sampled, array);
    // NOTE: now we're sorting the result.
    return sort([sampled].concat(drawN(remaining, N-1)));
  }
}
// sample 3 items from an array, without replacement
var draw3 = function(array) {
  return drawN(array, 3);
}

var pick_concept = function() {
  var concept = uniformDraw(["powers_of_2", "multiples_of_2"]);
  return concept;
}
///

// make arrays of all the powers and multiples of 2 up to 10:
var concept_examples = {
  "powers_of_2": [1, 2, 4, 8],
  "multiples_of_2": [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
}

// in the generative model, we chose a concept, and then sample from it
var generate_examples_with_condition = function() {
  var concept = pick_concept();
  var examples = draw3(concept_examples[concept]);
  condition( concept == "multiples_of_2" ); //option1: conditoned on the concept being "multiples_of_2"
  //condition( concept == "powers_of_2" ); //option2: conditoned on the concept being "powers_of_2"
  return examples;
}

print(Enumerate(generate_examples_with_condition));
~~~~ 

#### Questions
* What is the probability that [2, 4, 8] is chosen, given the concept "multiples_of_2"? (This is also called the *conditional probability* of [2, 4, 8] given the concept "multiples_of_2.")
* What is the probability that [0, 4, 8] is chosen, given the concept "multiples_of_2?"
* What is the probability that [2, 4, 8] is chosen, given the concept "powers_of_2"? (hint: comment out the line for "option1" and uncomment the line for "option2," then rerun the code and see what happens.
* What is the probability that [0, 4, 8] is chosen, given the concept "powers_of_2?"

### Infer category given number sequence

Now that we are bit more familiar with how your friend generates these numbers, we can tackle the actual question---given the numbers you observe (e.g. [2, 4, 8]), which concept is your friend most likely to be thinking of?

~~~~
///fold:
// a function that checks whether the elements (and order) of two arrays
// are the same, even though technically, the *arrays themselves* are
// stored in separate places and are not connected to each other, so they
// not "the same thing"
var array_equals = function(arrayA, arrayB) {
  return JSON.stringify(arrayA) == JSON.stringify(arrayB);
}

// sample N items from an array, without replacement
var drawN = function(array, N) {
  if (N == 0) {
    return [];
  } else {
    var sampled = uniformDraw(array);
    var remaining = remove(sampled, array);
    // NOTE: now we're sorting the result.
    return sort([sampled].concat(drawN(remaining, N-1)));
  }
}
// sample 3 items from an array, without replacement
var draw3 = function(array) {
  return drawN(array, 3);
}

var pick_concept = function() {
  var concept = uniformDraw(["powers_of_2", "multiples_of_2"]);
  return concept;
}
///

// make arrays of all the powers and multiples of 2 up to 10:
var concept_examples = {
  "powers_of_2": [1, 2, 4, 8],
  "multiples_of_2": [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
}

/* the inference process includes
*     * the generative model
*     * a condition on the observations
*/
var infer_concept = function(observations) {
  return function() {
    var concept = pick_concept();
    var examples = draw3(concept_examples[concept]);
    condition( array_equals( examples, observations ) );
    return concept;
  }
}

print(Enumerate(infer_concept([2, 4, 8])));
~~~~

#### Questions
* Which concept is most likely given the number sequence [2, 4, 8]? Does this match your intuitions?
* Which concept is most likely given the number sequnece [1, 4, 8]? (hint: replace [2, 4, 8] in the last line with [1, 4, 8])
* Suppose you saw the following sequences:
- [1, 4, 8]
- [0, 6, 10]
- [2, 4, 8]

What concept do you think these are examples of?

* Does our program make the same inferences? Try plugging these observations in to the model above.
* Can you explain the model's inference for the observed sequence [2, 4, 8]? (hint: How many numbers are powers of 2 and how many numbers are multiples of 2?)
* What is the conditional probability of [2, 4, 8] given each of the concepts?
* This is called the "size principle": your friend could have been thinking of "multiples of 2" or "powers of 2", since both concepts are consistent with [2, 4, 8]. But if your friend had been thinking of "multiples of 2", there are a lot more sequences she *could have chosen* than if she was thinking of "powers of 2". <!--The probability that she stumbles upon a sequence that happens to be full of powers of 2 when she was thinking of "multiples of 2" is a *lot* lower than the probability that she picks a "powers of 2" sequence that happens to be full of multiples of 2. -->

## Prior probabilities of hypotheses and concepts

In the previous examples, we assumed that the concepts "multiples_of_2" and "powers_of_2" are equally likely to be chosen. Is that always a valid assumption?

Suppose the friend who generated the number sequence [2, 4, 8] is a precocious 4th-grader. You know that she has not yet learned the concept of "powers." You believe that it is quite unlikely that she would be thinking about a number category as complex as "powers of 2." How does this change your belief about what number category she is thinking of, given that she generated the number sequence [2, 4, 8]?

///fold:
// a function that checks whether the elements (and order) of two arrays

// stored in separate places and are not connected to each other, so they

  return JSON.stringify(arrayA) == JSON.stringify(arrayB);
}

    return [];
  } else {
    var sampled = uniformDraw(array);
    var remaining = remove(sampled, array);
    // NOTE: now we're sorting the result.
    return sort([sampled].concat(drawN(remaining, N-1)));
  }
}
// sample 3 items from an array, without replacement
var draw3 = function(array) {
  return drawN(array, 3);

///

  return concept;
}

  "multiples_of_2": [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
}

var infer_concept = function(observations) {
  return function() {

    condition( array_equals( examples, observations ) );
    return concept;
  }
}

print(Enumerate(infer_concept([2, 4, 8])));
~~~~


## Sampling methods

Notice that there are many different ways your friend could have generated these examples. She could have sampled the numbers randomly, as we assumed in the code boxes before. Or, she could have sampled them in an intentional manner, to purposefully help you understand the number category and not confuse it with a different number category. Or, she could have sampled them in a different intentional manner--to intentionally deceive you into thinking that it is a different number category.

* positive examples
* positive and negative examples
* labelling things in the world

OED? If you have 2 competing hypotheses, what number should you test next?
