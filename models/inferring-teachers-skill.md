This is a model of evaluating a teacher's 'pedagogical skill.' We define this pedagogical skill as the degree to which the teacher maximize the learner's utility with her demonstrations. 

The model corresponds to an experiment in which an observer infers a teacher's skill by watching a teacher 'teach' a toy to a learner. The teacher teaches through demonstrating one or more functions of the toy. Some functions were more valuable than others, such that the best teachers weren't necessarily the ones that taught the most functions. The best teachers were sensitive to the differential value and prioritized the most important functions they knew. Therefore the resulting  estimates  of  teacher  skill  are  sensitive  to  the teacherâ€™s  epistemic  state  and  the  value  of  the  functions demonstrated. For example, the quality estimate of a teacher who demonstrates two low-value functions but also knew of a high value function will be lower than someone who just knew  the  two  low-value  functions  he  taught.   Similarly,  ateacher who knows both a high- and a low- value function would get the highest rating for showing both, a lower rating for omitting the low-value function, and an even lower ratingfor omitting the high-value function.

This is a webchurch implementation of the model described in Ref:Bass2015NotBN:
