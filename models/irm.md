The Infinite Relational Model (IRM) is a nonparametric model that,
given data involving different kinds of entities, discovers which
kinds there are and which relations hold between kinds. From the
paper by @kemp:2006uv:

> "Suppose we are given one or more relations involving one or more
> types. The goal of the IRM is to partition each type into clusters,
> where a good set of partitions allows relationships between
> entities to be predicted by their cluster assignments. For example,
> we may have a single type *people* and a single relation
> *likes(i,j)* which indicates whether person *i* likes person
> *j*. Our goal is to organize the entities into clusters that relate
> to each other in predictable ways (Figure 1a)."
