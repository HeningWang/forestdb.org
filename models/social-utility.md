title: Social Construction of Value
model-language: webppl
---

First, we set up our scenario: there are three restaurants, and each has an equal chance of being good or bad. An agent develops their own beliefs about the value of each restaurant by picking one, proportionally to their expected value in the prior, observing whether it's good or bad, and then conditioning on this observation.

  return xs[randomInteger(xs.length)];

  var s = reduce(function(memo, num){ return memo + num; }, 0, arr);
  return map(function(val) {return val/s; }, arr);

var restaurantPrior = map(function(restaurant) {
  return Enumerate(function(v){
    return uniformDraw(goodnessWeights);
  });
}, restaurants);

var agentPrior = _.object(restaurants, restaurantPrior);

// In fact, all restaurants are equally likely to be good
var observe = function(restaurant) {
  return flip() ? "good" : "bad";
};

// Condition on observation
var updateBeliefs = function(prior, event) {
  return mapObject(function(key, value) {
    return (
      key != event.choice ? 
      value :
      Enumerate(function() {
        var possibleWeight = sample(value);
        var possibleOutcome = flip(possibleWeight) ? "good" : "bad";
        condition(possibleOutcome === event.outcome);
        return possibleWeight;
      }));
  }, prior);
};

// Pick restaurants proportionally to their mean expected payoff
var makeChoices = function(prior) {
  var restaurants = _.keys(agentPrior);
  var avgOutcomes = map(function(key) { 
    return mean(function(){
      return sample(agentPrior[key]);
    });
  }, _.keys(agentPrior));
  var choice = categorical(normalize(avgOutcomes), restaurants);
  var outcome = observe(choice);
  return {choice: choice, outcome : outcome};
};

var timeStep = function(prior, remainingIterations){
  if (remainingIterations == 0) {
    return prior;
  } else {
    var event = makeChoices(prior);
    print(event)
    var posterior = updateBeliefs(prior, event);
    return timeStep(posterior, remainingIterations - 1);
  }
};

var res = timeStep(agentPrior, 500);
print(res["Taco Town"]);
print(res["Burger Barn"]);
print(res["Stirfry Shack"]);

We see that after many time steps, our rational agent learns the true value of each location.

Next, we add social influence into our utility function. An agent has relationships with others, represented by a vector of weights $w$. If the weight $w_i$ corresponding to a particular other agent is positive, they will slightly increase the value they assign to a restaurant when that agent has a positive experience there, and slightly decrease it when that agent has a negative experience. For now, we do not allow agents to change their relationships over time. We simulate three agents simultaneously, all of whom have positive relationships with one another.

We see that after enough steps, the three friends coordinate their values on the same location. If we turn the social relationship weights down to 0, we recover the phenomena we observed earlier: each agent evolves independently, and we do not see any coordination.

  Next, we allow agents to update their relationships based on common experiences. If one agent highly values the restaurant that another agent chooses, they will increase their opinion of that agent, allowing that agent's experiences to influence their utility more strongly in the future. On the other hand, if one agent assigns low value to the restaurant that another agent chooses, they will decrease their opinion of that agent, so that they'll be less influenced by that agent in the future. This relationship update rule is meant to reflect a basic "like attracts like" social dynamic. We tend to associate with people who have similar values (as evidenced through their choices), and therefore allow their experiences to influence our values more strongly. For example, if I have a friend who shares my taste in music, I'm more likely to take their recommendation of a new album than the recommendation of a stranger.

We see that several different equilibria can form, depending on the exact sequence of early observations. The most obvious is what happened above: all three agents converge on a single restaurant, and all have strong pairwise relationships. Another possibility is two agents with mutually strong relationships who have converged on the same restaurant, while the third agent has weak social bonds and prefers a different restaurant. A third possibility is all three agents prefering different restaurants and mutually disregarding one another.
