# A pragmatic speaker that can do basic composition and takes into account predicate noise. 

You can vary:

- color and size noise (fidelity)

- color and size cost

- speaker optimality

- context (lists of features)

This model is specifically to explore the interaction of noise, cost, and optimality parameters for a fixed context of interest from the Gatt et al. 2011 paper (big red, small red, small yellow)

# A pragmatic speaker that can do basic composition and takes into account predicate noise. 

You can vary:

- color, size, and type noise (fidelity)

- color, size, and type cost

- speaker optimality

- context (lists of features)

This model is specifically to explore the effect of varying the number of dimensions along which objects differ while keeping color constant as a non-distinguishing feature (as in Koolen et al 2013, but excluding orientation for the time being, ie just adding one extra dimension).

# A pragmatic speaker that can do basic composition and takes into account predicate noise. 

You can vary:

- color, size, type, and "one" noise (fidelity)

- color, size, and type (includes "one") cost

- speaker optimality

- context (lists of features)

This model is specifically to explore the effect of varying the number of dimensions along which objects differ while keeping color constant as a non-distinguishing feature (as in Koolen et al 2013, but excluding orientation for the time being, ie just adding one extra dimension) -- it also adds "one" as an utterance alternative with its own noise parameter, which should reflect that one is on average a very noisy 'type'.

# A pragmatic speaker that can do basic composition and takes into account predicate noise and color predictability via noun-specific color cost. This is brutal and ugly but works. 

You can vary:

- color, size, and type noise (fidelity, though size doesn't do anything)

- color, size, and type cost (though size doesn't do anything)

- speaker optimality

- context (lists of features)

This model is specifically to explore the effect of varying color predictability.

# A pragmatic speaker that can do basic composition and takes into account predicate noise and color predictability.

You can vary:

- color, size, and type noise/fidelity (tbut these don't do anything in this model)

- color, size, and type cost (though size cost doesn't do anything)

- speaker optimality

- context (lists of features)

- objects: 2-feature lists (color type) -- allows for manipulating color typicality. Currently three different objects are defined: yellow banana (typical), green banana (intermediate), red banana (atypical)

This model is specifically to explore the effect of varying color predictability.

# Color predictability effect.

The pragmatic speaker tries to get the literal listener to choose the intended referent (one of six objects with a color and type feature). The literal listener samples objects depending on the object's color (either inferred from prior or explicitly given in utterance). For unpredictable colors, the probability of miscommunication is high, so the speaker is likely to mention color. But, confusing: the speaker is happy to mention color even when it's very predictable (and even when you strike the other object of the same color from the context). Why??

# An implementation of the PRO model as reported in Gatt et al (2013, CogSci Proceedings, Figure 2). 

You can vary:

- x: color selection probability in the color-or-size condition (trades off with size selection probability --  color and size selection probabilities are 1 in the color-only and size-only condition, respectively)

- y: overspecification eagerness 

- context (lists of features)

- what the target and competitors are

This model is specifically to test the PRO predictions and compare with versions of RSA for the lightbulb-style contexts reported by Gatt et al 2011. They use x = .87 and y = -.05

A weird thing that results from the way they set this up is that in their second selection step, they sum up the preference for the feature (a probability) and the eagerness to overspecify (supposedly also a probability) -- but with particular settings of parameters (eg color-preference 0 and negative eagerness to overspecify, given the standard "lightbulb" context, this results in a negative "probability". This is awful.
