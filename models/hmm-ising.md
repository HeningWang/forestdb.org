A doubly-intractable HMM, meant as a toy model for speech
recognition with articulatory contraints.

          '()
          (pair (observe state)
                (hmm (transition state) (- N 1)))))
    
    (define (observe state)
      (map (lambda (x) (if (flip .9) x (not x)))
           state))
    
    (define (language-transition state)
      (map (lambda (x) (if (flip .8) x (not x)))
           state))
    
    (define (factor a b)
      (flip (if (equal? a b) 1.0 0.5)))
