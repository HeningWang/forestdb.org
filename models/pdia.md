The Probabilistic Deterministic Infinite Automaton (PDIA) is a nonparametric model that defines a prior distribution over all deterministic finite automata (DFA) with probabilistic output. Similar to the Infinite Hidden Markov Model, the PDIA defines a prior probability over sequences with discrete observations, with the critical difference being that there is zero uncertainty in the latent state sequence when conditioning on data - all uncertainty is in the transition function from a state/observation pair to the next state. This uncertainty is captured by placing an HDP prior on the transition function, where the previously observed symbol defines the context for the HDP.
