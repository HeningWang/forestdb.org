The rope-pulling model is a simple hierarchical model that illustrates compositionality in human reasoning.

    (define num-people 4)
    
    (define alice 0)
    (define bob 1)
    (define sue 2)
    (define tom 3)
    
    (define team1 (list alice bob))
    (define team2 (list sue tom))
    
    (define (sample-strength)
      (if (flip) 10 5))
    
    (query
    
     (define strengths
       (repeat num-people sample-strength))
    
     (define (strength person)
       (list-ref strengths person))
    
     (define lazy (lambda (person) (flip (/ 1 3))))
    
     (define (total-pulling team)
       (sum
        (map (lambda (person)
               (if (lazy person) (/ (strength person) 2) (strength person)))
             team)))
    
     (define (winner team1 team2)
       (if (< (total-pulling team1)
              (total-pulling team2))
           'team2
           'team1))
    
     (list (strength alice) (strength bob))
    
     (and (eq? 'team1 (winner team1 team2))
          (eq? 'team2 (winner team1 team2))
          (eq? 'team1 (winner team1 team2))
