Here is the biased coin model presented in Chapter 5.

    (define biascoin-model (lambda (sequence bias-weight)
      (enumeration-query
       
       (define fair-weight 0.5)
       
       (define isfair (flip))
       
       (define the-weight (if isfair fair-weight bias-weight))
       
       (define coin (lambda () 
                  (flip the-weight)))
       
       
       isfair
       
       (equal? sequence 
                  (repeat 5 coin)))))

      (hist (biascoin-model (list false false false false true) 0.2) "00001 is fair?")

      (hist (biascoin-model (list false true true false true) 0.2) "01101 is fair?")

The only difference between this model and the one presented in Chapter 5 is that we've made  `bias-weight` an argument to the function `biascoin-model`. `bias-weight` was a parameter implicit in the model in Chapter 5; by making it into an argument, we have made it explicit. Also, we have changed this from an `mh-query` model to an `enumeration-query` model.

Let's analyze the behavior of the model by looking at a number of different biases.
To compress out results, we're going to extract the `#t` probability; i.e. the probability that the sequence came from a fair coin.
