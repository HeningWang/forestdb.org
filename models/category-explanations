*All models on this page us an alternative form of the counterfactual model outlined at [forestdb.org/models/exogenous-counterfactuls](http://forestdb.org/models/exogenous-counterfactuls.html). An outline of the original counterfactual model can be found at [forestdb.org/models/because](http://forestdb.org/models/because.html*

### Fish

Below is a model representing a simple taxonomy of fish. Fish come in the northern and southern varieties, and each region has two species: wugs and dels, and haps and niks respectively.

Here I have the listener interpret `(because (big-fins) (eq? (species) 'wug))`. The most interesting effect here is that the model ranks the probability that dels (the other northern species) have big-fins as lower than for either of the southern species. This follows my initial intuition that the categorical counterfactual is interpreted in terms of the super-category: if a wug weren't a wug, it would most likely be a del because only one variable must be resampled. Thus, by saying ¬wug → ¬ big-fins, we are implying that dels don't have big fins more strongly than that the other species don't have big fins. Pragmatics will strengthen this effect because the listener will know that the speaker would say "big-fins because north" if both wugs ands dels had big fins.
