Forest
======

Forest is a collaborative repository for generative models.

Adding models
-------------

To add a new model to Forest, simply create a markdown file in the [models directory](https://github.com/forestdb/forestdb.org/tree/gh-pages/models). You can do this directly on github by following this link: [add model](https://github.com/forestdb/forestdb.org/new/gh-pages/models).

For examples of the model file format, see:
- [example.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forestdb/forestdb.org/gh-pages/models/example.md) is a model that *is not* shown on the front page.
- [arithmetic.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forestdb/forestdb.org/gh-pages/models/arithmetic.md) is a model that *is* shown on the front page.

For models that are shown on the front page, use additional header entries:

    model-status: code
    model-category: Concept Learning
    model-tags: concepts, program induction

Currently, the following status codes are available:

    code
    link
    code-fail
    stub

The following categories are available:

    Concept Learning
    Reasoning about Reasoning
    Machine Learning
    Nonparametric Models
    Bayesian Data Analysis    
    Undirected Constraints
    Inverse Dynamics
    PPAML Challenge Problems
    Miscellaneous

Tags can be arbitrary words or phrases separated by commas.

Updating webchurch
------------------

Forest uses [webchurch](https://github.com/probmods/webchurch) and [webppl](https://github.com/probmods/webppl) to run probabilistic programs. To update webchurch, follow these steps:

1. Clone and build the most recent version of the webchurch repository, following the instructions [here](https://github.com/probmods/webchurch):

        git clone https://github.com/probmods/webchurch.git
        cd webchurch
        git init (only if you are on Windows)
        git submodule update --init --recursive
        npm install
        ./compile.sh

2. Clone the most recent version of the Forest repository:

        git clone https://github.com/forestdb/forestdb.org.git

3. **Copy the files in `webchurch/online/` to `forestdb.org/assets/webchurch/`**.

4. Run a local webserver in the Forest directory and go to [0.0.0.0:4000](http://0.0.0.0:4000) to check that the changes did not break functionality:

        jekyll serve --watch

5. If code boxes run as expected, great! Commit and push. If not, you may need to adjust `assets/js/custom.js` in the Forest directory.
